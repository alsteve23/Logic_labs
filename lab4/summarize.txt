The code implemented creates a maze, declaring the nodes that are connected and the paths that are blocked. 
This maze works like an inderected graph.

The rules implemented allow to create a path between nodes that are not connected directly.
Besides, other rules provides the user an explanation of the decisions taken by the program.
The rule "can_move" decides if a movement is possible if there exists a edge connecting the nodes.
the rule "reason" returns the relation between two nodes.
the rule "why" explains why a node was added or not to the final path.
the rule "move" explores the maze until it finds a way to connect the given nodes.
The rule "find_path" return a list with the path betwwen the given nodes.
The rule " print_path" print the path found by the previous rule.
the rule "count_visited" counts the number of nodes that takes to move from node X to node Y.
